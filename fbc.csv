I called the other week for a certified check I was told there will be a $10 fee. Now I see a $12 charge fo my service fee. I just called me Branch and left a message to either refund my $12 or you are losing a customer."

While my family is Sidekix supporters through this contest and volunteers with them, it has been nice to learn about other non-profits around the country your team has helped do projects for! The Sidekix prom was amazing and the BB&T Client Care Center and Engagement Associates were amazing from top to bottom. It was a magical evening! One of your finest employees from a different department, George Fletcher Duke II , never left the dance floor. The prom attendees loved him! Thankful these people are a part of our community and your company gives back! Thank you!"

"51","UTTERLY disappointed with the bank. I’ve been waiting over a month for my new debit card. Over the years my statements and cards have been sent to my residential address here in Australia. Not only was my existing debit card that expires in 2020 canceled but after realising your error you send my new card for some reason to my investment property in Orlando ???? Why? When you’ve always corresponded and sent mail to my Australian address. I’ve waited over a month when I shouldn’t have waited at all for my own money from a card that was cancelled???? For what reason????"
"52","I went to 4 ATM’s today, and 3 were down, and 1 is no longer there.  It sure would be nice to access my money."

"58","Are you all aware that there is an issue w/ your phone lines"
"59","I live in Australia with a BB&T bank account. My husband recently had an amputation and I needed to transfer my funds but BB&T online doesn’t have that facility. I told my business banking manager that I would be using my debit card to pull out funds from an ATM here but the bank canceled my ATM card which expires in 2020 for non use! They were supposed to have sent me another card but it’s been a month and I haven’t received it. I’m really at a loss here and don’t know what else to do!"
"60","I received an email from u and I don't even have an account with you. The title is ""Suspicious activity""."

"66","Use cautionI got a call they are very convincingI only picked up because BB&t appeared on my phone caller I.d.When they asked for my pin and I said you don't need that - the caller hung upAlways hang up- if you ask for their name and number and say I will call back they usually hang up !

I was in a panic state on about June 12th, my loan officer, said hey man we are good for your June 24th closing. Most likely looking like a July 15th closing. Just Ludacris."
"72","My well respected, veteran brother who is currently the Air Force JROTC instructor of the year attempted to deposit cash into our widowed Mother’s account today with a BB&T deposit slip and was told that BB&T would not accept his deposit because it “might be fraudulent.”  He presented his ID (His wife was out of town with their non BB&T checkbook) and was still denied service. What lunacy is this, BB&T???"
"73","Beware!!! BB&t charges a $12 maintenance fee if you don't keep a certain amount of money in your account. That's with multiple mortgages and a credit card with the same bank. Will be going to a credit union shortly."
"74","How am I spending my summer?  Standing in a BB&T branch getting no acknowledgement that I even exist, much less getting  help with a problem.  Walked out the door not served.

"84","I have worked for BB&T for a long time now, and I am so thankful for the opportunities that I have been blessed with... and I will always hold that name in high regard.  But now I am looking forward to working for Truist and to use a Kelly King phrase... I still think our best days are ahead!"

"91","Truist,  as  in  altruist.  Pretty  awesome  if  you  take  a  second  to  try  and  understand  what  the  company  is  trying  to  do...the  message  it  is  sending  to  its  clients  and  prospective  clients.  How  would  that  be,  in  any  way,  bad?    If altruism  is  the  focus,  to  serve  the  client  in  ways  that  keep  the  client and  what  they  want  and  need the  #1 focus,  well,  that  would  be  utopia  in  the  banking  industry  or  any  business,  wouldn't it?    BB&T  and  SunTrust  are  striving  for  perfection!    Greatness  that  will  benefit  generations  of  Americans!    Why  not  embrace  that?"
"92","I just hope it's a smooth transition for us account holders. Bbt customer for over 25 years and hope I won't have to spend time changing over all my bills that are set up through drafts. Truist....I trust? <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089>"

"94","I continued to Bank with SunTrust after I moved back home to PA  7 years after living in  Oviedo , Florida for 22 years due to my husband’s job transfer  . I am excited to once again have a branch office close by . Please don’t close all the Branch Offices in Northern Upper Dauphin County !"
"95","Truist will be what we make it!  Proud to be both a teammate and a client of Truist!"

"102","Been a BB&T client for 20+ years and I have nothing but respect for the company's customer service and professionalism. I hope we'll have more of BB&T qualities than  SunTrust.  The few interactions I have had with SunTrust have not been favorable."
"103","Oh my. Not a great choice. Did the board pick that? Clearly, no marketing input was used."
"104","I have banked with BB&T for many years !! I would like to keep all my accounts number no changes"
"105","No. Do not like that name<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0096>"
"106","Stupid name for a bank."
"107","Sounds like a new allergy medicine"
"108","That’s The Best The Marketing People Could Come Up With ??"
"109","Please ensure that you get a refund from the marketing firm that suggested this ridiculous name.  I will be closing my accounts.  If you can't handle a simple name change, you can't be trusted with my money."
"110","I sure hope you didn't pay someone to come up with that name because in a word it's stupid. The only bank that has a more stupid name is Mr Cooper. Go back to the drawing board and try again."
"111","Fist bumping CEOs and a name no one understands.  Why do I have this creepy feeling they are installing screen doors on the vault  at my local branch as we speak?"
"112","Expected something far better... unfortunately disappointed."
"113","Sun Branch Banking & Trust....at least it sounds a little more professional. Geez!"
"114","That name is HORRIBLE AND STUPID. That will make people leave just because of the name<f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0084>"
"115","Should be sonofab for new name. I have been a bbt customer for decades.  My parents used suntrust. I can't stand suntrust. Not sure if i am staying or leaving. Just aggravated!"
"116","Sunburst  would have been a good name."
"117","I closed my bbt account.  6 weeks later I get a letter saying I owe them an overdraft fee!I'll be closing my suntrust account now.Truist is a stupist name.  Did you have an elementary school have a contest?"
"118","I have to say I’m not a fan of the new name. That being said, I have been a customer of both BB&T in NC and SunTrust in VA. Both are great companies and I feel they will compliment each other. I just hope they both continue to have a strong commitment to their customers. Wish them both the best as they become ONE!"
"119","Well hopefully #TRUIST will lower my mortgage interest rate and up my savings account interest rate now that they want to become a MEGA bank. I wont hold my breath but I'll be waiting for my HUGE good faith interest repayment check to be direct deposited in to my checking to help me with the transition."
"120","I have already moved my account before everything started changing. Glad I did!"
"121","Glad I don’t bank with either! What a brilliant name! Not!"
"122","Stupidest name ever.  Were you not true to us before?  Are we going to find some Wells-Fargo scams?  I think I am going to have to end my 30 year relationship with you because there is no way I can have that name on my checks and ATM card..."
"123","I bet John Allison does not like it."
"124","I do not like the new name at all!"
"125","Frankly I think it's a dumb name.  Suntrust is represented but how do we relate to BBT?  How is it pronounced?  Frankly you corporate folks could have come up with a more inclusive name representing both banks.  My 2 cents...which might just be switched over to a different bank in the future."
"126","I have been s BB&T customer for thirty years and was an analyst there for ten years. This is embarrassing. Sounds like a social media platform or dating app. Sorry but not professional."
"127","@BBT worst rebranding name ever for this merger of 2 banks. I'll can't even tell people I bank here it sounds hideous. You spent millions to a firm and you get this...my 7 year old could have done it cheaper. #worstnameever #bbt #suntrust #hideous #letcustomersvoteforaname"
"128","What a waste of money! How about call it BB&T and change the Suntrust banks to make them BB&T and that way it won’t cost as much as renaming all the banks. Not really feeling the new name and if you ruin the wealth division like you did with this name change I will be looking for a new bank!"
"129","Having connections with both BB&T and SunTrust, I think the choice of ""Truist"" for the new name is a POOR selection.  If this is the best you could come up with after spending money and time, I wonder about the new combined organization.  Apparently Wall Street and most people agree with me.  Still not too late to try again."
"130","Truist is.......underwhelming at best. SunTrust is a great name because Sun refers to the east, a new day and new horizon, growth and prosperity. Branch Banking and Trust is stable, solid and dependable. Truist sounds like a millennial focused bank that may or may not be financially sound and exclusively markets through Instagram. I am personally excited and hopeful for this merger. Please try again on the name."
"131","I see a post above where BB&T that says account numbers will be changed.  If that’s the case, that’s most likely when I make a move after 27 yrs.  (I also had a separate acct with Suntrust for a couple of years a while back. I closed it due to hideous customer service so I’m not really fond of a merger with them anyway.)"
"132","I wouldn't be surprised if they paid high six figures for ""Truist.""  The person that came up with that is ""Stupidist."" Go, leave Winston Salem and choke in the traffic of Charlotte."
"133","I am excited for new opportunities coming to the clients and employees of the new company. The best is yet to come for all!"
"134","PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Allow “We the Customers” of SunTrust Bank have a vote in what the Bank Merger with BB & T will be called.I became a SunTrust customer when my bank “Crestar” was bought out in 1998. (maybe earlier).The PROPOSED Merger name is just dumb and meaningless, especially for my generation of “Baby Boomers”.You have emails of most of your customers. Send us an email or postal mail with a Choice of names for the combined banks.Waiting for a Suntrust response."
"135","Not crazy about the name"
"136","That’s a really stupid name.  Doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue."
"137","I guess BBS&T was just to easy I guess"
"138","I love BB&T and have always had a great experience with my bank! But I do have to say, this new name...I hope y’all didn’t spend a lot of money on a marketing team for that. It looks like the name of a pre-paid credit card company<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0091>"
"139","I will have to confess that I do not like the new name. Maybe you should have done a poll or something so we the people could have at least gave an opinion on the new name. I mean the name you did choose means unconditional concern etc. ..  So far it has not lived up to it's new name. Just saying!"
"140","I knew this made-up word reminded me of something, but I don't see it as a positive. Scary to see the definition of that word... ""tryst"" is what came to mind. :("
"141","I surely am glad I sold my $500k worth of BB&T stock and bought a house even though my grandfather was on the original Southern National Bank Board. My son worked for Suntrust for a very brief time but decided that the best thing for him to do was leave once he found out how Suntrust operated."
"142","I love BB&T but I do not like this new name.  I like the word and love the positive message they are trying to send, but the word just doesn't work as the name.  Imagine everyday conversations, ""who do you bank with?"" ""I bank with Truist.""  At first glance, it looks like trust is misspelled and it seems to be lacking or missing something.  With all that is coming together in this merger, I really expected something better..."
"143","Thank you for calling Truiest at Travelocity, this is Alex Trabeck, how may i trust or trick or treat the truth out of you."
"144","Good money was paid to come up with Truist? Really? In the TRUEist sense of the word...stupid! Been a customer 25 years. Disappointing name choice. Tryst? Truss? Itrust? Stre$$? Whatever...fodder for mockery. Will never say it."
"145","A month ago I joked with my branch rep (BB&T) I’d change banks if the new name blows.This is so campy I might follow through."
"146","I love bbt. I have 5 accounts with them. Love them and trust them.Hate the new name. First... There's already a Truliant bank. Second... It sounds like an artificial sweetner... Coca-cola, now with 0 calorie Truist. Or some medication on tv that has side effects like diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, impotence, and in some cases death.Suffering from painful genital rash? Ask your doctor about Truist. (May cause vomiting or death)"
"147","I literally just opened a business checking account with bb&t a week ago. This new name is so bad I'm seriously reconsidering. I keep picturing myself saying ""I bank with Truist"" and it's just not happening. They had uncontested layup with Sun Branch Trust (SBT)n somehow blew it. The so called big wigs just had to over think it. N to think they paid a firm quite handsomely to handle this project..lol. Texas was already a difficult market for you guys, this won't make it any easier"
"148","This will be the 3rd incarnation of my bank in the last 5 years or so. They just keep getting bigger and bigger and the service gets smaller and smaller. We are out of there!!"
"149","This name is just awful<f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+00A6><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> I pray the app doesn’t change because I love the app and if it changes I’m definitely moving banks. Especially if my routing and account number changes. What’s the point in staying with a bank if everything changes."
"150","When I received a phone call from my Private Advisor this morning my first reaction was it is an odd name for a bank.  However when I served on the board of Susquehanna Bank in Hagerstown, MD I found many people from outside the area could not pronounce the name.  I am not as concerned about the name as I am the services the bank provides and the wonderful customer service they provide at my local BB&T Bank in Greencastle.  Looking forward to learning more about the merger."
"151","I noticed that BB&T only responds to  the post that like the name change.   I for one, DO NOT LIKE THE NEW NAME!!  May need to look into changing banks,  if the transition is as bad as the last bank merger I went through!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+00AC>"
"152","I've been a loyal BB&T customer literally my entire life (34 years), my father worked there years ago, and my mother just retired in January after 50 years of service. In a time where other banks constantly change their name in an effort to reboot their image, we have been honored to be a part of the history and heritage of the longstanding BB&T brand. That said, we are all extremely disappointed to now see Branch Banking & Trust disappear just like all the others."
"153","I thought about Branch Banking & Sun Trust...<f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+00A3><f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+00A3>"
"154","I've been a customer for a long time and the name alone is making me consider a new bank.  Seriously?  It's awful."
"155","As long as they provide me the same great service as they do now. I don’t care what they call it. I honestly couldn’t even tell you the last time I even went to a branch.  Shine on BBT!"
"156","As a long time BB&T customer (my late husband opened his first account with a predecessor when he was 9 with his grass cutting money) and a BB&T stockholder (inherited from my late father), I’m waiting and hoping that all goes well."

"159","Ugh. As an employee of a different bank, I'm dreading when all account numbers change and people throw out check books without shedding them. As a bb&t customer, I'm annoyed they'll be changing at all."
"160","I hate the name.  It makes me think of snake oil and used car salesmen.  My husband actually said that if you change it to Truist, he plans on taking our business elsewhere."
"161","How bout name it Bust? Fitting."
"162","Sorry BB&T, I’m not impressed with the new name."
"163","I love B B and T  but hate the new name “Truist” !"
"164","So is this the way yall let loyal customers know? This is our Money! Even though I understand it's not going anywhere, it send me as a customer on edge that we are informed though social media instead of a letter or at least on the app I check daily."
"165","Please! Please! Go back to the drawing board on that name! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A8>"
"166","Joining the chorus of folks greatly disappointed about the name chosen for the merged banks.  Really?  Couldn't find something better?  Very poor choice in my opinoin."
"167","Just a thought. When my kids one day give me grandkids I’m sure they will pick out a name without consulting me or my wife. That’s how it should be, if they pick a name I’m not fond of, it’s not going to change how I feel about my grandchild. The name itself is just a name. It doesn’t matter if I like it or not it’s still my grand baby. So if it’s Truist they want. It still gonna be my Bank. Just pick a really cool Nick Name and roll with it."
"168","Yeah, not a fan of the name. Going to be even less of a fan if my account and debit numbers all have to be changed for every automatic payment, direct deposit, etc."
"169","Frankly, Not a fan of the name ."
"170","I sure hope you can make it simple and painless for all of us with many direct deposits and electric payments done from our accounts . New passwords & changing account numbers and such is not something any of us look forward to !"

"173","I’ve been reading the feedback folks have expressed. I understand the “knee jerk” reaction to something so new prior to this  announcement, unheard of. These 2 banks are expressing a whole new way of moving forward as a financial institution, as new generations move into their adult lives. It’s time. Change is good folks!! Kudos for the courage to step out of the “norm” and “step in” to the forward thinking new!!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E>"
"174","No. You can't rationalize this dumb name.  Better to admit it rather than  dig in.  If you can't come up with something better, pay me a zillion dollars - I will assemble 5 random people and give them 5 minutes -  and they will come up with something better.  Truist me."
"175","What a bonehead name! Maybe it’s time to move my money to a bank that takes itself seriously."
"176","What a stupid name. I’m gonna change banks just so I don’t have to say it."
"177","Since BB&T and Suntrust are now being sued for the new name,now would be the time to replace 'fire' all those that were involved,make a note to never hire firm again that was involved in the 'new name' require all upper management to watch  the video that was created in making the name and label the workshop  how fail at doing your job."
"178","Dumb name, hate it, , BB&T has majority ownership, save money and just change the Suntrust to BB&T...Do you really thing Truist somehow works better than “Best Bank in Town”...c’mon man.A customer from WS."
"179","I don't want to know how many millions you paid a firm to come up with this stupidity."
"180","Still crossing my fingers that the regulatory approval doesn’t happen. Customers ALWAYS suffer - at least in the short term - when these mergers happen. You will find new, unexpected fees being applied to long-standing accounts and all sorts of other headaches that require fighting with the “new” bank to fix. I’ll be closing my accounts and moving to an established bank or credit union that has already worked through all the customer inconveniences if the merger is approved.

"191","I did not care for the name until I saw the logo.  I didn’t understand why you didn’t put the logo in the background for the announcement. The name seemed to make sense once I looked at the logo, but closer inspection suggests another company with the same name has a great logo that is already trademarked. Oh well."
"192","I am so embarrassed of this schmaltzy name and to be a customer of this bank. Please reconsider the name. It is terrible. Aarrrggh!"
"193","""Truist""????  I know everyone has an opinion but just to express mine, this is really a bad name.  As a Braves fan, I cringe at the thought of seeing that name every evening on the Braves home games.....to say it like my 10 granddaughter might express displeasure.....""Truist…...ewww""!!"

"206","BBT- There is no “I” in Team...  but there is an “I” in “Truist”!! I am not a fan of your new name. However, names are just a part of you. It’s all about your associates that work for you everyday taking care of customers like me!! The “We” in the company!!"
"207","Where did you all come up with a dumb name like Truist?  I love BB&T and really hate having to change everything.  No one asked me so guess the customers opinion doesn't count anymore.  Sad these companies that continue to mege will not always be in the best interest."
"208","Please reopen the branch that was closed at Landis and Union in Vineland,  NJ."
"209","Truist?  Are you for real?  What an awful name.  Did you survey it?  I sincerely hope you didn't pay someone or some company to come up with that abomination.  It's so bad I'm wondering if I need to change banks."

"215","Why lose all the goodwill and reputation you built under the strong BB&T trademark?!"
"216","Not a fan of the new name."
"217","What about checking account numbers, will they change yet again? It is a tremendous hassle to have to notify all my direct depositors and bill paying."
"218","Come on y'all. The name sounds like something that a bunch of hippees dreamed up on an acid trip."
"219","Decades ago I opened a checking account at Forsyth Bank in Winston-Salem and have been a loyal customer through the years, despite mergers, acquisitions and name changes. I must say that I am not happy with your new name, Truist. It sounds like something a “big city” marketing firm developed and sold the Board on. If you want to serve primarily wealthy clients that name might be fine. But if you want to include middle and lower income customers, the name is not geared to that demographic. Don’t forget BB&T’s roots! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>"
"220","Don’t tell me TRUIST IS THE NEW NAME????"
"221","If they are so great why are they firing long term employees.   At my branch 2 of the best employees fired.  Woodhaven Office NE Phila.     Dot & Kelly.  Pathetic reason."
"222","It's gonna be Bank of America 2.0....big bank that will lose that small bank feel."
"223","A perfectly horrible name. Sounds like a cult. ""I used to be a Christian, but I was indoctrinated and now I am a Truist.""  I wrote everyone on the Board of Directors to complain. I have never left a bank because of its name but I am really tempted on this ridiculous decision. I don't want to be associated with a cult."
"224","Truist really that’s the new name. That’s got to be one of the worst names you all could have gone with."
"225","Stupid name for a bank! I'm sure you paid millions to some marketing firm to come up with that. Bad investment."
"226","Not crazy about the new name"
"227","Oh my word. Seriously, while I have been banking with you BB&T for years and have no complaints whatsoever, this lame, idiotic name makes me want to close my accounts and move on. Did you all let the children of the CEOs come up with this? Just horrible."
"228","I have never seen so many people but hurt over a company changing a name. And I must say most of the complainers don’t look like they are those dang entitled millennials you all love to complain about."
"229","I think you need to rethink the name ""Truist"". It is ridiculous. And we all know what happens when 2 banks merge. Goodbye customer service and the personal touch. You are now to big for your own good. Just like what happened with Bank Of America."
"230","Terrible name in my opinion."
"231","What is wrong with the BBT or Sun Trust Names? At least there is a history behind the names."
"232","Just keep BB&T. I don’t like Truist at all"
"233","here is a better and easy name ""The BANK"""
"234","Why don't you use bb trust"
"235","Both  stupid  and  ridiciculous  name  change!..."
"236","For those of you who don’t like the name, don’t worry the name will change in a few years when they merge with someone else"
"237","What a ridiculous name to go along with a ridiculous “merger.” Can’t wait to switch banks soon!"
"238","But is it a unified brand like First Horizon?"
"239","SunTrust left our community hanging last year by closing all of their branches with 90 day notice. It took me six or seven months to get every thing changed over to other banks including BB&T. However if I had any idea that these two would merge I would never have used BB&T. What a mess as thousands of elderly people wondered about trying to figure out what to do."
"240","Terrible name choice and not an appropriate or luring name for a bank, sounds like a new sugar free sweetener. You keep trying to spin the decision as to what the name says about how you plan to conduct the bank however I say that will be demonstrated by policies and customer service. I find the name embarrassing and may move my BB&T business to one of my other banks I deal with.  How about another fist bump..."
"241","Wonder how much they paid a branding specialist to come up with that name? Too much for sure."
"242","The only ""legacy"" of Bugs Bunny & Tweety is lousier customer service than the DMV. If you want a REAL fresh start, then close out all your books on debtors and begin anew and start treating customers with respect.

"245","BB&T had two locations in Glasgow KY. Recently, the largest branch closed, the unbelievable beautiful building sold. The combining of two locations into one has caused clients extreme dissatisfaction of only having one location to bank with BB&T. This has caused long wait times outside and in. Extreme inconvenience to serve clients on extremely tight time schedules cause them to have to leave and can not wait. I retired from BB&T after 37 years of employment. I continue, whenever possible, to encourage clients to try and understand the lack of employees available. Technology is used by most everyone, but it is not working for all. We presently have 7 banking operations in Glasgow and a Credit Union. Way too many banks for a town this size. I suggested a simple name for the merged banks “Trust Bank” simple, but combining name for both. Please help these small towns thrive thru this by providing the best rates on loans and deposit programs. I worked on three mergers and there are many things to prepare for."

I have 20 yrs of banking experience - First Virginia Banks which became BB&T in 2003 when Chairman Fitzpatrick decided he wanted $10M in his pocket to retire while hundreds got laid off.I know how the Crestar systems merger went with SunTrust.  Fiasco.  There’s a another new bank name option.  These two banks will again be laying off hundreds of redundant employees while the board members pocket money."

Now we have to come up with a nickname for Suntrust park, because NO ONE will say, “headed down to Truist Park”..... DUMB!  People should be fired over this nonsense."

Some people worry about the most insignificant things. <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0084> If you are a long time customer and you have had no problem with service and you are now seriously going to change banks because of a name change, your life must be quite boring and sad. I just hope that when they merge they will move the tellers from the Suntrust building in Homestead Fla. across the street to the BBT building or vice versa. The Homestead branch has to be the worst BB&T location I have ever used."
"309","You really should have run this  name past your customers as 6 out of 10 say that this name sucks.  After 30 years, I am looking for a new bank!"
"310","This video does not change my mind. Surely you could have selected a better name."
"311","To all those fussing about the name and saying they’ll be leaving. Don’t you think a better idea is to wait and see how good their service is, after all “ a rose by any other name is still a rose”."
"312","If I have to change account numbers, credit card numbers or pay for new checks, I absolutely will close my account. I hate having to do this, as I've been with BB&T for more than 20 years. There are just too many other financial institutions asking for my business. And the new name is not a good choice at all. Truist. Trulicity. Truvia. Trulia. I'm guessing you paid many people for their time to come up with this name. While you might have been going for the true definition, it just doesn't get it. I'm presuming you did focus groups and studies before all this? You obviously weren't talking to your customers. I am so disappointed."
"313","Will BB&T customers will have to go to the bank after the merger and change everything over and reopen new accounts? That will be a headache and who has time to do that? Or will everything roll over and work itself out. What if you have 4 separate account with you guys so would people have to reopen all accounts? Will we get a notification when to do everything?"
"314","The BB&T name has been around for over a 100 years, and this is the best name you can pick? How about leave it alone. Especially a name recognition that’s been around over a century."
"315","Sounds like a great way to lose investors and depositors."
"316","The Truist name gives no indication of what business you’re in. It’s going to take a lot of time and money to let people know it’s banking and financial services. The current names do just that."
"317","This is my 3rd bank merger. Really getting tired of this. I will have to get new checks all over again for personal and business."
"318","Could have done better.  You own the trademark for Premier Bancshares from your early-2000s Atlanta-area merger, would have been a way better choice."
"319","Am sorry but your branding/new name  is not inviting. Should go back to the drawing board. Have only been customers for two years so no allegiance to you like all the other people who are telling you that you messed up on this"
"320","Ridiculous name.  Doubt there was any real market research that went into that name. Now I’ll have to redo all my bill pays, order more checks (again!!!) and try to memorize more long account numbers. Might as well switch banks now."
"321","I remember when Bank Atlantic changed to BBT. My automatic deduction still accepted the old account number for awhile this would be betterMake sure you update your direct deposit into because even though it may still process your bank may charge a service fee to transfer it overThis is all speculation on my part the old numbers may not even workBBT just a suggestion you may ease the transition by not charging for new checks that's just salt in the wound"
"322","When more work went into making a video to explain why you chose the name ""Truist"" than actually choosing the name ""Truist""...Odder still is that you paid a marketing/research firm to come up with such a name (that is a real word, just unfamiliar to most) and then had to pay them again to produce a video to explain why the name was chosen.Even odder, is that this video was already made, in apparent anticipation, that BB&T and SunTrust customers would not like the name and/or not readily associate its meaning to one great bank...and SunTrust.Word association in marketing only works if your target audience already associates said word.  Now why did I just order 500 new BB&T checks....lol!!"
"323","So we willNeed to order new checks and everything?"
"324","Really stupid name.  Having worked for banks for most of my work life I have learned that you need not have common sense to be in a position of authority. Loss of name recognition for a name that is meaningless.  Must have been dreamed up by the same people that name new prescription drugs."

I will embrace the new name and culture because if not for BB&T my life would not be as excellent as it is now, 17 months post-retirement...  change is unavoidable in this world and I believe I understand the sentiment and purpose behind the naming.

Opening new accounts after having dealing with BB&T with client accounts, I was very pleased at how professional and caring the account manager was in opening our account. Will be relocating to their home city and look forward to continuing my banking relationship with them. As two new banks have merged into one, please be mindful to keep rates of return competitive for those of us who are savers. Realizing your bread and butter comes from those who borrow and at times are in debt, not all of us choose to live our lives that way and would enjoy a decent return on our money. Thank you."

We went to the branch and they told us the application is wrong don’t trust in that is weird most of the banks use they applications and the balance is correct. If you deposit a cash money after 6pm the founds are not available the same day and you need to wait until the next day. That’s not good for the costumers. Other issue we had the bank offer us a card machine and they didn’t explain us about 485$ anual fee for the machine. We didn’t use the machine and we try to give them back. We need to pay a extra 295$ fee!! That’s crazy."
"427","Well let me share about your greedy fees. I just cashed a check someone sent me from a BB&T account. They charged me $8 because I am not an account holder.

I cannot BELIEVE this bank is threatening to charge my great grandmother for pulling her bank statements from 2014-2016.

What bank charges its customers that much money for a copy of a bank statement?!?! With our experience with this poor customer service we plan on considering switching our account."
"455","My experience today I had at BB&T bank in Fairfax VA (Chainbridge Rd). I normally don't complain much, but because this is my 2nd incident with BB&T within 2 weeks, I just need to vent a little. My 1st complaint:Ok so today I walked into BB&T bank in Fairfax Va, (chainbridge rd). There was only 1 teller at least that's all I seen at the time I and waited in line for the teller (Nyla) to finish with the customer  that came in before me (not a problem). I waited  about 5 minutes or so until she finished helping that customer.  So the customer finished and I walked up to her  she said how can I help you. I told her what I wanted and gave her my identification and bank card. Meanwhile another customer came in (an older Caucasian lady), (and yes I am African American female)she greeted her with a big hello and asked her if she wanted the other teller that was at the drive thru window to help her. Now at this time I had a blank stare on my face (wondering why she didn't ask me while I was waiting). So the teller at the drive thru came over because she probably heard her tell the lady she can help her.  So the lady said no I will wait for you. So at this time I asked the teller Nyla do you only ask certain customers and why didn't you ask me. She said oh she is one of our good customer and she comes in here all the time (and had a smirk on her face) I said oh I must be chop liver. (you all can read between the lines)..Dissatisfied  customer today. 2nd complaint;I wrote a check and I transferred the money from my savings to my checking account earlier in the day about 10Am and they cash the check later that evening and charged me an overdraft fee of $12.50. I called the customer service # that same day and they transferred to another # which never answered. So I went to a branch in Richmond Va and they REFUSED to reverse the charge. If it was my fault I don't mind paying, but in this case it wasn't. I will probably close my account and go to another bank.."

I felt like they dismissed me quickly and didn’t care that the reason I do it was because I was in the military. If people are just confused just ask but don’t go telling people not to do it again because it confuses you and are just too lazy to do your job.

"513","Hi BB&T, got a quick question. My checking account was overdrafted last night by a large fraudulent charge to a Nebraska Furniture Mart, all of which are about 1,200 miles from where I live. I called BB&T, and the nice lady who answered the phone quickly identified the fraudulent charge and told me that she would block my card so that no further fraudulent charges could be made. She said that my new debit card would arrive in 5-7 business days. I asked her when I would be reimbursed for the fraudulent charge, and she said that I would have to make a separate call after the charge is posted (rather than pending) so that the fraud department could determine whether or not the charge is indeed fraudulent. Anyway, my question is, has BB&T contacted any physicists to examine this amazing phenomenon in which a charge can simultaneously be fraudulent and not fraudulent? I think it could rival the double-slit experiment when it comes to understanding the concept of quantum superpositions. Anyway, I have to go, Sparky's convenience store is about to throw out last week's donuts, and if I don't get there before the mean raccoon, I'm going to be panhandling for at least 5-7 business days. Thanks!Love,Ben"
"514","I've been with this bank for 40 years. I have checking, savings, credit card, and mortgage.  They have now decided it would be a good idea to charge me fees for checking. Are you kidding me, every bank now has free checking. I will be leaving this bank for good. What a horrible decision on their part. So disappointed in a bank I use to love.  I will never do business with them again. You want a smart savings tip? Don't keep your money with these clowns."
"515","is that the cash you took from me?"
"516","The last time your website was unavailable for login, BB&T customers went through several days of hell, unable to access our accounts, unsure if payments made were being honored by BB&T, and being absolutely kept in the dark about what was happening. Unable to login today to my account is reminiscent of that chaotic crash. Your customer service rep was polite when I called but hesitation and concern in his voice gives me pause... What's up, BB&T?"
"517","You could at least let us know what is going on with our accounts."
"518","Can't log into my account, are the cards still working??"
"519","Likewise here in WV... can’t log into site!"
"520","BB&T you win I never in my wildest dreams figured I find a bank more crooked than Wells Fargo."
"521","with name God is not better. its racist cartoon heros not help me but speeding up"
"522","Bad things happen to good people this scum bag bank will never give you a second chance"
"523","My husband and I left sometime back, and seeing this makes me glad that we did, and SunTrust is even worse than BB&T in terms of their customer service and finding new ways to nickel and dime customers with fees and how they process transactions to try every way possible to overdraft accounts."
"524","Next week I will move to a local bank .. I moved to BBT because they were big and local .. now 10 miles away from home and 30 miles from work !! Unbelievable they wouldn’t call every customer and try to keep you .. how many have they lost already?"
"525","My BB&T branch closed on April 12th. It’s now a 10 mile round trip through heavy traffic. Hopefully the Suntrust branch a mile away will become a new branch after the merger."
"526","I hate this bank already. I am a very sick with cancer single mother. Some nights I’m tired and can’t cook. So I send my oldest child to the market to get dinner for her and her siblings. She goes to pay and card kept declining. Well I call and they say fraud placed a block on my account. No one called to warn me or anything. Stated they have a couple questions. Smh. So I ask to speak with fraud. If course they are closed. Now I have to wait until tomorrow. And have to explain to my kids why there is no dinner. I’m contacting bbb and making sure the news gets this info."
"527","I love BB&T but I am NOT a fan of SunTrust. This makes me very nervous. I live in CT and I don’t want to change banks. I’ll give it a chance but it’s already difficult to bank when you don’t come farther north than NJ. I hope you don’t lose your quality..."
"528","And then you close our local Stanley NC Branch.  I have been a BB&T customer since back at Southern National in the 60's.  I have banked at the Stanley Branch since 1982,  First you took our Loan Manager so we had to go to another branch for loans.  Then you took our Bank Manager except one day a week by appointment only.  Then you took our long time Customer Service girl and replaced her with someone who could not answer question so we had to go to another branch for assistance.  And then you closed the branch because there was not enough walk in traffic... there was nothing there to walk in for.  Not only did you take the branch, you close the ATM as well.  Now to deposit a check I have to spend 45 minutes going to another town instead of going through the drive through at lunch time.  This is my first time needed my branch since you closed and believe me, for time and convenience, I will be moving to another bank... Thank you for destroying an almost 50 year relationship  :("
"529","No longer a bank about the customer and loyalty. Run!"
"530","No one needed or wanted another mega bank.Such a horrible loss."
"531","But you continue to close our f”ing branches!!!"
"532","here's the best thing you can do. make your slogan ""we wont rip you off"" and then STICK TO IT. because right now, you dont have a whole lot of fans"
"533","I have been employed by BB&T for 20 years. Proud to work for a great company with integrity and values.  My goal for all of my clients is to help them be financially successful. BB&T has given me the training and knowledge I need to make this possible, I make four commitments to my clients RELIABLE- RESPONSIVE EMPATHETIC AND COMPETENT. I ask my clients to hold me accountable for these commitments AND I also ask them to be responsible for their accounts. BB&T is the Best of the Best!!"
"534","I pray that BB&T adopts Suntrust's policy of allowing 24 to 48 hours to balance accounts. I've gotten nearly $500 in overdraft fees over the past 3 weeks. When I called to explain that I was rear ended and couldn't drive for work --- that the $40 in charges shouldn't have resulted in over $300 in fees, they said ""Hey. It's policy."" So, being without a car, the next week, two more fees hit. I balanced the account and put a little extra in - just in case. Even left my card at home. Guess what??? They did some creative accounting, back-tracked to charge me a fee, ensured the count went negative and hit me with a second fee. This is vicious and intentional. And, I have no other choice but to zero out the account and close it, because it is a hostile relationship. I'm not suggesting anyone abandon ship, because most conventional banks have similar policies. I'm just saying - if you're exptecting BB&T to be there for you if and when things go wrong (even a little wrong)...no. They are going to pile on and bully you like everyone else. You're really on your own. Make no mistake about it. Same corporate greed and rape of the little man that has been eroding the fabric of this country for centuries. Sorry! BB&T might be a lot of things. But, they've gotta' own that too."
"535","Can’t wait to see what the new name will be. Whatever it will be, the newly combined bank will be one of the best in the country."
"536","BBT Best Bank in Town."
"537","I’m hoping for the best but we went to BB&T because Sun Trust was not interested in getting our 8 accounts! BB&T has been great but, should it go south after the merge, I’ll make the leap to a credit union."
"538","I’ve always liked BB&T, not so much Sun Trust! These “mergers” aren’t always a good thing. I will stick with BB&T, and we will see!"
"539","I'm only concerned about changing the name of SunTrust Park in Atlanta lol"
"540","Love everything about my bbt branch, Everyone there is great and they have so good to me. If they close the Sunset Beach branch don’t know what I’ll do<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2>"
"541","After 800 in supposed overdraft fees, I'll never resist BB&t no matter who they merge with. I can't wait to cancel my accounts"
"542","Sorry but they can never beat “Best Bank in Town”"
"543","The best bank ever"
"544","BB&T was always a good bank, SunTrust never was will give it a chance  but I am hoping for the best."
"545","I have been with BB& T for a long time and will stick with them through the merger. I hope it will be good and they will continue the good service I have always received."
"546","Holding my savings account hostage for a secure credit card I told you I did not want, now gotta wait who knows how long for my money to be available, smh. Soon I'll be going to one of the many banks that offer FREE veterans accounts, unlike BB&T... Yall should be ashamed"
"547","Sun Trust employees need to be ready to push products. That all BB&T employees do all day. Sell credit cards, loans, business products, investment products, insurance and ect. If you don’t meet the goals they put you on a plan of improvement. Good luck that’s why clients walk out of the bank with products they didn’t want. BIG BANK"
"548","Run like the wind from this bank! Worst bank ever. Closing all accounts hopefully the end of this week. Cant even apply payments to an account correctly."
"549","Rachel Poor Ireland another bank change <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AC>"
"550","This is horrible. Went to Suntrust to get away from ""BB & Fee"" and now I am back again!"
"551","I worked and retired from BB&T after 16 yrs I’ve been a customer for longer if one includes the banks it took over. I went through two and BB&T’s was as smooth as any merge can be. I’m hoping this one will be too, and I won’t lose any of my retiree perks. Hope all goes as well for the clients as I’m sure this merge will go for the bank ."
"552","So, definitely not keeping their marketing business in WSNC"
"553","I like a small hometown bank.  Not happy about the merger"
"554","I was told my account would be unblocked in the next 24 hours after providing multiple pieces of verification. But yet they are still not taken responsibility. It seems all this came about because I opened a savings account online and made a typo in the street name. All of this including my kids being unable to eat you would think they would act responsible. No. They are playing the blame game. This is far from over."
"555","I would have thought they merge or buy up a bank that was in different states towards the north and west. But suntrust is in same locations on east coast as BBT."
"556","Well in my case I have been with yall 17yrs and because I made too many transaction from my Savings account yall closed it so I think that I will be changing banks. That is not right."
"557","BB&T you’re not loyal to your customers. You have ruined our daughters credit over something she had nothing to do with according to the police investigation that was performed on her account.  We have been customers for almost 20 years and you did not show us in any way that you appreciate your customers or stand by them."
"558","Great company the bank sucks but what do expect from a bank that practice banking skills under general rommel"

"568","Yall have charged me 8 over draft  fees back to back even for going 1 penny over boom 36$ closing my account soon because i gotta pay over 350$ in over draft fees to get out of the whole"

"575","How can I close my account?"
"576","WHY NOT TO CHOOSE BB&T BANK 1.  THEY HOLD YOUR CHECKS. Yes, even checks from the same people from the same banks.  Deposit it on a Friday,  your check will not clear until Tuesday and you will receive a notice of it clearing on a Wednesday. 2.  FEES -  They will charge you overdraft fees large ones.3.  NO FORGIVENESS -  Most banks that I have worked with and credit accounts will offer forgiveness and waive a fee.  Not these guys.  Even if you visit their branch.  4.  LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE -  They simply do not care about their customers.  If they did they would work to help keep a customer from leaving. Major lack of caring is what I experienced. 5.  THIS IS A PREDATORY BANK... HAD I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I OPENED UP MY ACCOUNT I WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO EXPECT!!!"

"580","Why can I not get a payment to post to my car loan?  I schedule a payment to come out the 12th of each month and it has been coming out each month until this month.  I made sure the payment was scheduled for the 12th, then I made the principal only payment I make every month, but this time the payment did not come out.  I called customer service and talked to Andrew who looked to see why it didn't come out, couldn't say why but the principal only payment came out. Today I check my account to find that Andrew, who we gave our account information to, still did not take the payment out.  So I called again to see why it has not come out, Stacy didn't know why, finally I had her take the payment out and I verified it online while she was still on the phone.  The money for the payment was there to be pulled out on the 12th like every month, and every month I make a principal only payment.  On my end it showed a scheduled payment of $662.37 for April 12 so I made my principal only payment on the 12th, as I do every month.  This is ridiculous to have to spend this much time trying to get a payment applied to a loan, I have never had this much problem before.  I would like to know why, is it because I'm paying the loan off early?  If you aren't going to pull the payment out on time maybe I need to use a different bank.  I need an answer as to why the payment was not being taken out even after I talked to Andrew and requested the payment be taken out immediately.  If I hadn't checked I wouldn't have known that you failed to take the payment and apply it to the loan.  This had better not affect my credit rating!"
"581","Are you open today, Good Friday?"
"582","How can I close my account?"
"583","How do I get thru to a live person?  I have not been able to connect to my online account due to a system error for several months now.

Phone system informs me ""you cannot be helped, please contact a Representative""...how??? There is no option for that and the call just disconnects.

"586","Stay away from BB&T. Horrible Bank! Not only are the branches a complete disaster, lack knowledge from bank procedure to regulatory compliance, the customer service is that much worse ... lack simple banking knowledge and are in need of major training. To make matters worse ... the executive/escalation team is unresponsive and there is no one to speak to.

"588","Yeah funny you guys posted this.  I tried doing my taxes today before the cut off, but since you decided not to actually deposit my paycheck into my account(for some unknown reason you only credited my account $100 instead of the full $1,147) I was unable to file before midnight.  I also made a grocery purchase after the deposit, so now I'm overdrawn. I never had this problem at my previous bank, any paycheck I deposited physically at a branch immediately was available. If this is how you guys do things, I'm going back to united community bank. This time of year is stressful enough without worrying when you will decide to make my funds available. And no, it wasn't a post dated or 3rd party check. It was just a normal payroll check.Now I have to pay you guys an overdraft fee and I will have to pay the IRS late fees and tax penalties."

So we found out we in the hole.  First we were told the card would be blocked... well that didnt happen... so more charges showed up the next day.  Then they wanted to mail the paperwork to us instead I went into the bank and signed the paperwork.  Was told it would be a day or two and it would be fixed.  Well wake up this morning not fixed and more overdraft fees added.  And when I called about status got told that by Law they can hold our money for 5 days to investigate.  I said what the hell is to investigate you know its a scam because it happened to others.  So here we are sitting here in the hole..... bills not paid... no money to live on....

And to top it off, no one at BB&T will help her to resolve this matter. Isn't that what your fraud department is for? Why will they not help her? Why is it that when she called two days ago, on the day the charge was made, she was told nothing could be done until the charge is no longer pending?

"785","This is so true,I am closing my account today,regardless of the location I never get good customer service"
"786","I had 4 identical charges of $472 post from an account in Nigeria  and although they reversed them and gave me money back, they later debited the same amounts after I sent their paperwork in twice as a fraud  claim.countless phone calls and now my account is overdrawn by $2K.well BB and T, you can eat it cuz I was able to cancel my DD so I will carry my business somewhere else.  yall suck!"
"787","BBT I faced fraud with your account, and with all respect your employees cannot handle one simple case, because of which I am facing financial losses!"
"788","BB&T Just had $1000 stolen - could someone get me an IP address without being passed around your call centers?"
"789","BB&T is at the top of the list !!!"

"791","Nope you dont do enough or even seem to act quickly. Just had 1900 stolen thinking  BB&T had protected me but boy was I wrong. What they allowed to happen was sickening"
"792","BB&T Just had $1000 stolen - could someone get me an IP address without being passed around your call centers?"
"793","Bbt can you please help me understand why regardless of the location if its in Georgia or Florida why I ALWAYS receive bad customer service? Literally everytime I go into a branch."
"794","Hey BB&T are you guys down right now for mobile?"
"795","Bbt shows incompetency towards its customers. We faced a clear fraud atm withdrawal case and have been contacting bbt for 10 days now regarding the matter. They send us from one department to another and I have a feeling we will not get our money back. BB&T we contacted your support staff through calls and emails the last ten days and your incompetent staff does not want to resolve the problem. I hope you can help somehow. Please assist"
"796","I am having problems accessing my account online and on the app. It says the company is aware of the issue and is working to fix it. That was well over a month ago..."
"797","How much money do you need to have in a BB&T account to get a Christmas card from your branch? I'm just curious because I've been a small business banking customer for years and I've never gotten one. I was in another business in town today and saw theirs (from the same branch I bank at) displayed, so I was like ""hmmm...."""
"798","The bank of overdraft fees even if you have overdraft protection Now they are talking about consumers protection... huhuhu"
"799","I was a victim of fraud yesterday and no one will respond to my emails today."
"800","Your ceo needs to read comments on yalls bbt page"
"801","Thanks for taking my entire paycheck in overdraft fees.Merry Christmas to you BB&T. My Christmas won't be very merry.Struggling people beware. BB&T won't be very sympathetic."
"802","Yeah I know exactly what you mean you ought to try dealing with a bunch of idiots when somebody's actually spelled your identity and still on money out of your account keep in mind I've been waiting for since 2016 for BB&T to give my money back and I'm done waiting on them they don't know how to run a bank anyway that's why they have someone standing behind them telling them what to do now just saying that's what I like about telling the truth never have to remember what she said it may not be pretty but I guarantee you it's still the truth and the people that work for BB&T or a bunch of Bloomin idiots"
"803","Fraud... ""In Law is deliberate deception to sucure unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right"" !!! Which he has done and everyone at the bank for ten years to me.... Got the proof in writing from them just a few weeks ago...  10 years they have denied me my legal rights !!!! Rot In H*ll you worthless piece of Sh*t !!!"
"804","If you are a Muslim, do not do any business with this bank, they are racists and discriminate against Muslims."
"805","I opted out of overdraft charges and still being charged overdraft fees"
"806","This bank is a joke, and I’ve only been a customer 2 months!!!! I’m actually seeking an attorney as I type this comment. I was charged $108 in overdraft fees due to a pending transaction causing the account to become $7 short. A pending transaction!!! Called the bank told me nothing they can do. Still waiting on a call form corporate. I will not lie down and let them take my money"
"807","I’m tired of dealing with all their technical issues, never have I ever dealt with a bank with so many issues.. time to move on."
"808","This has absolutely been the worst banking experience of my life.  I have no idea how you are still in business.  Will be closing my account ASAP!"
"809","AGAIN YOU LOCK ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNTS  I NO LONGER WILL BE A CUSTOMER  TOMORROW I AM CLOSING ALL ACCOUNTS  YOU CAN TAKE YOUR BANK AND SHOVE IT. HORRIBLE SERVICE"
"810","I’m surprised this bank still in banking business. They should close it down fast"
"811","Hey Kelly...can you tell me why your online bill pay keeps sending checks to established bill pay recipients and those checks end up coming back to me???? And how you're fucking with my business credit by doing that? And why I've been on hold now for over 15 minutes with your customer non-service? Can you help me out, Kelly?"
"812","Not there when you need it most. Bank elsewhere"
"813","I mean...does the website crash at other banks? This is ridiculous"
"814","What a joke !!!!! Better take your Vaseline dealing with them!!!   Day 3 after hiding an authorization letter for 10 years to cover up the forth charge of fraud in my opinion that included the bank and can’t get copies of what took place except the first and only one they printed which was the 10 year old Authorization .... Thank you Paradise for the call the other night or I still would not have known and was refused again the next day but had your number...... Charged the person for fraud 3 times but question and hide the forth at my expense.... And He never has responded to anything himself and I personally think he knew about the Authorization letter as well... He refused to respond like everyone else to any of my letters to him or emails or any questions.... Just a conspiracy from the top down in my opinion as I know after all the contacts I made to him personally that he had to check into what took place and made sure I could not get any info by the law they try to hide behind.... And the hidden Authorization..... That’s my opinion of what is going on here !!!!"
"815","Any plans for a tap to pay debit card??"
"816","BB&T sucks. Had my acct with them for 20+years! They recently started making people show their ID to ""deposit"" CASH into their own acct. made up some shitty excuse about it. One of their branches refused to take my deposit because I would not wait around for their SLOW teller to get me a receipt. I'm tired of ""ARRANGING"" my schedule around you! I have liked this bank all up to 1/2 way through 2018. Your changes suck!"
"817","THE WORST EXAMPLE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EXPERIENCED IN MANY YEARS."
"818","Bb&t loves overdraft and they practice it on all customers.No one ever will get any satisfaction from this bank ."
"819","Such a disappointing experience with this bank. Sitting here trying to close out my account. I shouldn't have to waste my day to discontinue services because of not being satisfied"
"820","my account is overdrawn  $1900 because they refuse to block 4 identical charges of $472 from an account in Nigeria.  I've spent countless minutes on the phone on several occasions, sent in paperwork stating the exact same stuff I've told several people on the phone and my account still stays over drafted.  BBT, you wont handle any more of my money!"
"821","You closed the wrong branch,  Why close the Adrey Kell Branch? Never get greeted when first walking into the Ballantyne branch. Let you wait forever even though two customer service rep were not busy. Two days ago, a teller opened a new account for a customer and the line was getting longer by the minute. Customer service at Ballantyne Branch is for the birds. Time to change banks."
"822","My BB&T card is likely going away.  You changed my account to paperless without my knowledge then froze my card after not paying a bill I never got in the mail.  Rather than reaching out to me you sent me a letter and by the time it got to me and I immediately went to my online bill pay and paid the bill you deactivated the card.  Now in the 3 years plus I've had this card I have NEVER carried a balance but this apparently doesn't count for anything and did not raise any flags that maybe I didn't get the initial bill.  Disappointing is the nicest way I can state my situation currently.  Looks like I'll be shopping for a new card to replace this one."
"823","I’m trying to shop online with this card now and I will be canceling it!!!!  I’m calling the  customer service number and there is a 56 minute wait!! I’m trying to make a purchase with this useless card.  Thank goodness I have not gotten rid of my old card yet!"
"824","I like how my account is not set to overdraft, from the beginning.  And somehow you allowed a 94.00 charge to go through out of 13 dollars, and since I don’t have my account set up to overdraft, I used three dollars.  And then when I pull the app up I find that you somehow opted me into overdraft protection...which is illegal.  Will be pulling from this bank ASAP, thanks for the two overdraft fees by the way."
"825","Your spending TOO much on cute marketing that generates TOO many upset customers!  Hubby tried to make a withdrawal at a poorly designed atm that had terrible sun glare. So he tried again which generated a fraud alert and Email. I tried to call the two numbers listed in email. first one I tried twice and gave up while listening to a dozen ‘very special offers’ cough, cough. The second number told me I had an invalid ss number. NOW I’m prompted to put out a fraud alert on whomever is supposed to be managing your customer service department. Of course this is sooooo STINKIN frustrating after years of excellent service you may have a corpse at the head of customer service!"
"826","That’s not true because other banks offer a lot more than Bbandt and you are closing a lot of branches because of mediocre services"

My extra time and effort to make sense of all of this was just another reason for them to send me a BS excuse for them to hold my money for no reason!"

When I told them that I was told to check opt IN I would be covered. They said no, that is wrong...that means you want OD fees......who in their right mind would do that?????????

I could only deposit a check or money order since I’m not on the account .. that’s is the dumbest rule I’ve heard so someone could write a potentially a bad check but won’t take cash that makes no sense. I have been in the banking industry for 20 years and worked for Bb&t for 6 of those years and never had such ridiculous rules. I will never use them again and will tell everyone about my experience."

Your business is under the impression that it is up to ME to file a ""dispute"" with MY bank and wait about 10 business days to get the $103 refunded to me.Why is that? I didn't cause this. Your business did.  Is the way you do business really?? Bb&T is slow, substandard and well.....pathetic?? Why should it be left to me to square this away when BB &T equipment malfunctioned and left me with $103 less. Not much money, I know. But it's mine. This is inexcusable in the year 2018, almost 2019. I'm ashamed of you and for you. P.S. I want my money BB & T literally STOLE and now wants ME to jump through hoops to get back."

Despite the fact that this is theft I am left with no money in my account and told I have to wait to see if it posts or not.

I called customer service and they said the same thing. I explained that I had the funds in my account even though I had pending transactions, it’s not my fault how the items are paid. I asked what options I had and the customer service rep said “you can close your account”. I was so mad I hung up. I tried several more times to contact the branch manager, she refuses to call me back. I called customer service one more time, asked to speak to a supervisor, the woman said, she will tell you the same thing, so don’t waste your time. She gave me the option of filing a “claim” to get the fees refunded, I’m quite sure that will be denied too. I’m going to file a complaint also, $108.00 is a lot of money. I am also going to file a complaint with the Attorney General, The Federal Reserve, and I may call the local TV station."

"917","Today was bitter sweet. At 2:00pm our local BB&T Branch closed it's doors. The bank so many people fought to keep open. The bank that was supposed to remain a part of our community.The bank, that when you walked in, the tellers knew your name and family. The bank people remained loyal to.I have mixed feelings about this. Should we have fought harder? Would it have made a difference? On the other hand they don't deserve the ""Heart of Marion County"". They don't deserve the loyalty or our business. BB&T has become more about the product and it's shareholders and not the customer. One thing is for certain going to miss Bev Pitek and the girls!The positive coming from this bitter sweet day-BC Bank will be opening (I told you not to mislead by those trying take advantage of the circumstances) soon! I have had the opportunity to meet with some those associated with this bank and they are going to be a wonderful fit in the ""Heart of Marion County"". Best of all they are a West Virginia bank! I encourage you to stop and get to know them! Support your local businesses!<U+270C><U+FE0F>"
"918","It is insane how hard it is to communicate with BB&T.  I go to the website to pay my bill and it says ""can't help you, use the U app"".  Go to the U app and it says ""can't help you, go to the website"".  Call the phone number, it gets my information through the automation for an electronic transfer and then says ""oops, nobody working right now... call back later"".  Try to find an email so that I can communicate with BB&T and they don't have any.  So I'm relegated to posting to freakin' facebook with the hopes that someone, anyone will give a damn enough to respond.  I tried the 5228 number but I can't get anywhere with that because I don't have a deposit account and therefore I don't have a pin... even though the option I chose was the one for non-deposit accounts."
"919","But yet after 2 weeks you can’t get my banking online?  Geniuses"
"920","A suggestion for you?  Check your phone lines especially at night after 6pm.  No seems to answer the phones.  Everything goes to a machine answering machine and no calls back.  There is one that no one answers at all.  There is no way anyone can call and speak to a live person at night."
"921","Couldn’t find anywhere else to post this on this page, so I will post here. People need to be aware. This place is a disaster. The tellers are so incredibly rude. I’m not talking about one, I’m talking all. MULTIPLE occasions I’ve had to deal with down right nastiness, getting put on hold for 30 minutes just to have to call back and find out “they were busy and forgot to get back to me”. That’s what just happened with their teller Lexi, and last time I deposited a check through the atm and it didn’t accept all of it, instead of being nicely informed of what was going on, Amanda, another teller, got nasty with me and told me all ATMs are “use at your own risk” and that there was “nothing she could do for me” followed by a hang up. Then called back and asked to speak to a manager and was told “there was no manager for the week, just them.” I have NEVER wrote a review on any business but I feel almost personally attacked by these people. They all need to be replaced because they do not have good customer service at ALL. When it comes to someone’s money and finances, we should be treated with respect and care. Not an attitude from every woman working in there Because they simply don’t want to be bothered and would rather stand around and talk. Worst BB&T I have EVER been to."

"1077","DON’T DO BUSINESS WITH BB&T!!!!!! Why you ask? Because if you overdraft they won’t let a family member come out money on your account, unless you are on the account, to prevent an overdraft on your account so they can steal your money.

My mother is a trucker and a part of the backbone of American commerce. She can’t make it to BB&T locations all the time, so I usually help her like a good son.

"1093","DON’T DO BUSINESS WITH BB&T!!!!!! Why you ask? Because if you overdraft they won’t let a family member come out money on your account, unless you are on the account, to prevent an overdraft on your account so they can steal your money. My mother asked me to put $10 in her account for her but the teller refused to take legal tender and deposit it in to her account. My mother is a trucker and a part of the backbone of American commerce. She can’t make it to BB&T locations all the time, so I usually help her like a good son. Instead of letting me help my mother they decided GREED is more important than good community relationships. They don’t care about customer, Truckers, or any of us good people of America. Close your accounts and move banks if you agree with me and the hard working people of America! Stay well my fellow Americans."

YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAMILY. Kelly King an staff you rock. God bless all of you. We will come back stronger. God brought us through another storm, but this too shall pass. Again let me say THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART."

Then today I attempt to go in and make a deposit so the money is there today so I don’t run into said problem again . The teller says I can’t because I’m not listed on my wife’s account , who by the way is working during your open hours . I wish a random person would deposit any amount they wanted , but it isn’t . It’s just her husband trying to take care of a bill . I’m going to make sure that she closes this account that she has had for the 15 years we’ve been together , and takes her business to where I bank without the hassles endures here !"

My daughter, son-in-law and 16 month old grandson left with what the could pack in a Jeep.  They’ve been with me for a week and cannot return for another week. I’ve spent most of my ready cash, helping them with food, clothes, crib, gas, paying their bills since they cannot work, taking care of the dog and cats, and in general, trying to bring some normalcy to a bad situation.  I’m 68 and do not keep idle money laying around.  I’ve run low on money in the bank and withdrew money for my Fidelity account.  I brought the check into the bank and the BB&T teller said a hold would have to be placed on it.  Seriously?  I have auto deposit on my work paycheck and Social security check.I’ve banked with BB&T for 3 years, about two years at this branch.  The people at the branch I had in Virginia were super nice and helpful.  This counter people at this branch are insensitive and don’t want to be bothered with what their customers are experiencing.Guess I’m looking for a new bank!"

Now BB&T  is not helping in anyway recover the missing $3,000. After being on hold for over 4 hours the past two days, every customer service person has transferred me to someone else. I have no clue if or when I will ever see my money again."

"1194","DON’T DO BUSINESS WITH BB&T!!!!!! Why you ask? Because if you overdraft they won’t let a family member come out money on your account, unless you are on the account, to prevent an overdraft on your account so they can steal your money. My mother asked me to put $10 in her account for her but the teller refused to take legal tender and deposit it in to her account. My mother is a trucker and a part of the backbone of American commerce. She can’t make it to BB&T locations all the time, so I usually help her like a good son. Instead of letting me help my mother they decided GREED is more important than good community relationships. They don’t care about customer, Truckers, or any of us good people of America. Close your accounts and move banks if you agree with me and the hard working people of America! Stay well my fellow Americans."

I want to inform people and customers about it.I check my account to pay off my CC bill today 7th Sep, and I found that a withdrawal was made on 4th Sep, for $3500. Oops!, It was not mine and it had the description of TELLER CASHED CHECK withdrawal. I called the Bank branch immediately as I am out of the country. I saw an image of the Bank check submitted, which is printed with details of withdrawal but with a fake signature. They took my details and the Branch Manager will call back, and I am still waiting since the hour. Now, how can the Bank teller execute a transaction for a check submitted with my details on it WITHOUT my ID and Bank A/C check card or my SSN?. How can this happen?. Are they that stupid or negligent about customer accounts?. Now, they are reviewing camera's to see who came in at what time to execute this transaction. But my point is, how did the teller violate the procedure for this transaction without the proper ID and verification. Even the signature is fake.  To me, it seems like this Bank staff are negligent about securing people's accounts and their money."

I ended up waiting several minutes for the teller, I believe her name was Samar, to realize I was there, as she appeared to be eating obnoxiously odorous food in the back.  All the while, not one other employee offered to assist me in spite of them all making eye contact with me.  Not one employee even spoke to me, until I started calling into the back behind the teller window.  Then I got a faceful of lunch breath from your teller.  Great experience.  Will definitely recommend."

If your wise choose a local credit union to do your business with , they actually care about the community they operate in . BB&T does not care about helping you . I went there 3 times in the scorching heat , just to try to deposit that cash for my wife !   I am certain their bottom line is not so good in my town .  No common sense ."
"1302","Please fix your atm at Englar road.  It counts cash incorrectly almost every time you deposit.  Tonight I tried about 20 times and only got half my cash deposited.  I have reported this problem at least six times.  It is ridiculous that a bank machine can’t count money.

Now it has caused trouble in my family . I will never forget this , its so stupid .     There is never a problem dealing with the local credit unions , they understand its a common thing when people are too busy with things and send other people ...just to drop off a simple deposit ...omg !"
"1320","Good luck when fradulent charges pop up on your account. BB&T are no better than the thieves that stole it in the first place."
"1321","Same problem. I live in NY and have an account in Pa. My ex has been depositing cash in my account for years. Now all of the sudden they don't except cash deposits, even if you have a deposit slip with your name on it! What ever idiot ever thought this up certainly didn't think it through. How ridiculous, I have been dealing with banks for 50 years and never heard of anything so outrageously stupid, a bank that doesn't take cash. By the way there was no letter or notification of this new practice sent to me in advance. If you are thinking of opening an account here I strongly advise you to shop around for another bank. Their polices stink and their customer service is terrible. They will probably soon be finding themselves going out of business. Hmm, I wonder why."
"1322","Except it doesn't. We just got hit in Fort Valley and charged with 419.00 OVER the amount of the fraud, and apparently we are stuck having to pay this because the bank won't adjust for fraudulent charges. The 419.00 is NOTHING but overdraft fees from Saturday afternoon until this morning!!! The actual other issue is covered but these charges are outrageous. They can't tell us where the fraud happened and they refuse to do anything about the charges. The first set was covered, but the charges are not and $36 charges a day for 4 charges...and all within a few hours of checking the account to update my ledger, not the 7 day assessment they claim. I caught the charges, not the bank, and to make matter worse, they shut the door and locked it as my husband was coming in to deposit his check and then didn't fully deposit it for three days. It finally went in this morning but it was completely absolved by the overdraft fees caused by the first set of fraud charges. It's absolutely pointless trying to have a reasonable discussion with our assigned banker, so I have absolutely no recourse except to put it up here and nope this isn't my given name but this will be the last week we have to go through this much drama trying to get something sorted out that shouldn't be an issue to begin with. Like I said, de-regulation is great for banks, but not so great for everyone else. This is absolutely absurd and I would love to hear the physics based explanation for cramming a 7 day assessment into a few hours because if you think  dealing with having money stolen from you isn't bad enough, just wait until this bank starts!"

On August 22 i checked my mobile app to see their balances and decided to transfer all the money from the secondary to my main account since there was no pending transactions on the secondary, it results that an old OLD purchase dropped on the secondary just after i checked and completed the transfer. THERE WAS NO PENDING TRANSACTIONS and now BBT is charging me with an overdraft fee $36. A month ago i went to my closest branch to instruct them on not to allow any transactions if there is no money in the accounts and it happened again, in less than two month i have around $144 in overdraft fees. Is this right???"
"1379","Yeh. How about this. Set up my online bill pays to come out today.......  BECAUSE I GET PAID TODAYand wake up yo not one,  not two,  but three overdraft fees!!!!!  Oh and of couse thats my fault so they wont reverse those.  Needless to say i will be switching banks asap,  as well as my family members.  This company has screwed us all over MANY times....."
"1380","Still awaiting a LOC lien release on an account paid in full a month ago."
"1381","The online ability to access BB&T credit card statements is still not working.  I have been checking daily for over two weeks now and it is still not available.   I understand it is being ""looked into"" but a bank as large as BB&T should have some sharp IT people who should be able to fix this problem in hours, now weeks.   Is is really being worked on???"
"1382","Terrible service!! Anyone know the number to the big dogs?? Tired of messing with the phone channel and the branches!!"
"1383","We switched banks after using BB&T for over 10 years! Who knows how much money they’ve thieved from us, and countless others over the years!!! Switching was the best decision EVER!!! We’ve been with our new bank for almost a year and have yet to have an unwarranted overdraft fee, plus we now have a savings account and credit card. Funny how things change when you do business with a company that has ETHICS!"
"1384","Online access for credit card statements is lacking.  We haven't been able to access the statement information for almost a week now.  I have called customer service three times.  The IT department has left for the day and from what I was told tonight anyone who had this credit card from BBT did not have access through their desktop.  Not much of an IT, if they have gone home and not fixed the problem if it is this widespread.  On a second note, I waited 38 minutes on hold before actually speaking to the customer service person.  It was just as bad on the previous two attempted calls."
"1385","closing my accounts tomorrow  I am sick  of your on line service or should I say lack of same"
"1386","Do you enjoy convenient online access to all the same information you're used to seeing on your paper bill? What about an alert that will let you know when a new bill arrives – DON'T GO TO BB&T!!!"
"1387","I am experiencing terrible online service. Tried to log on my online account multiple times using both my laptop and my phone for the past couple weeks but failed. The website always says service is unavailable. I called the customer service phone number couple times and waited for at least a hour each time but no one picked up."

"1394","You need to reconsider the closing of Rich Creek VA BB & T Bank. This bank serves so many areas that will be so neglected once closed. A good portion of Monroe county and the eastern side of Mercer County will be forced to travel downtown Princeton which I normally travel there once in two months time or force people in Monroe county to travel to Pearisburg VA to meets their needs. This is a huge inconvenience to your customers and more than likely you will lose a large amount of BB & T customers.  If it is necessary then leave us an ATM machine at least!"

As a business owner who has an extremely large relationship with Association Services (they work with Condo and Homeowners Association and they are terrific group of individuals that exceeds 10M in deposits), the small business side of BBT is beyond useless.  Before you even think of opening an account check elsewhere.  I can tell you from years of experience that at BBT relationships mean nothing on the retail side of the business.  There is an excuse for everything.  The local corporate leadership in South Florida is deplorable."

"1420","Been a customer since before it was bought and changed to BB&T. I have fraudulent activity on my account and the customer service representative MANUEL M (all the information he would give me) told me there was no way for me to even find my own info on my account to verify for him, I found it myself while still on the phone with him he said still sorry there was nothing he could do even after I got the information correct. He doesn’t know how to do his job and he certainly doesn’t care about helping me as a customer, he would even let me close my account with you because I was so upset I want to switch banks, he couldn’t verify me so he couldn’t close my account. I EVEN OFFERED MY SOCIAL SECURITY AND PHOTOS OF MY ID AND ANYTHING I COULD GIVE. He still said no your not who you say you are and left me with my fraudulent activity on my account. Also not to mention the 30 minutes I waited on the phone to even speak to him. Not like I’m working or have a job or anything, I love dealing with banking issues on a Friday at work who doesn’t?!? If you love problems and no solutions then this is the bank for you. If nothing happens from this post I will petition at your branches all weekend for the next month and take to all the social media I can to uncover this criminal activity going on within this lowly established business."

"1422","Not going to happen.  Im sorry but i just left a branch that REFUSED to give me cash back on a cashier’s check of which my deposits equal four times the face value bc I didn’t order the cash in advance.  If you didnt have that amount of cash on hand you aren’t much of a bank. Also she didn’t know what a passport was as an ID and customer service call wait time is 51 minutes.   Bank shopping."

Customer service is horrible and they are a complete fraud with how they post transactions every representative will have different answers never the same completely disgusted I was with Susquehanna and NEVER Had the issues I have dealt with bb&t they are so disappointing and I even spoke to Supervisors who were worse !!!!!

Of the last 4 times I've tried to use my card for online purchases, three of them were declined automatically with no alert sent to me via e-mail or phone even though I have it set to send to both. There's no point in having a card through BB&T if I can't actually use it and then have to spend an hour on the phone trying to get in touch with their fraud department to try and clear it.It seems like it may be time to start shopping around at other banks that actually have their systems operating correctly."

"1532","On Thursday, July 19,2018 my husband and I went to the BB&T location in Elkin to withdraw funds from the ATM.  After several attempts with no success my husband went inside the bank to get the withdrawal.  He told the teller his card wouldn’t work in the ATM, to which she replied she would order him a replacement card.  No mention whatsoever that there would be a charge.  He was able to use this card later that day to make a purchase at Combs Meat Market, Elkin.  So, 1)  obviously it wasn’t his card that was defective it was the BB&T ATM machine and 2) at the very least the teller should have informed my husband there would be a charge.   We have been a client of BB&T for30+ years.  We built our home with the help of BB&T, we’ve had CD’s, IRA’s, home equity loans and credit cards and paid/pay everything we owed timely, never late.  Now in our senior years when our budget is impacted by medical bills so that every dollar is important, BB&T appears to not want us as a client and have no qualms in slapping a “fee” on everything.  We can no longer use an atm that’s convenient, we are forced to drive to a physical BB&T bank (10 miles from our home to either Elkin or Yadkinville),  we can no longer maintain a savings account and transfer funds from savings to checking (electronically) without a “fee”.   And now you are going to charge a “fee” for a card that is a saving and convenience to you.  Paper checks are certainly more costly for you to process.When we first started using BB&T you were a principled, client focused, NC bank.  We have 3 checks on direct deposit and 2 automatic withdrawals.  It’s going to take some work to change all that but we are considering it.A $5 charge will not break us financially, but in principle we should have been informed, it could have been a $500 charge."

If you have personal or business accounts with BBT the service is not what it used to be.   PNC is kicking them all around on the business banking side.   They cant expect to be building relationships as they cut back on service and close branches.    The human factor is gone.  Everything is driven by AI"

I've had checking, savings, CDs, a mortgage and investment accounts with them for a very, very long time. They have decided a savings account isn't a savings account unless I WITHDRAW money from the account. This has to be done in-person, at a branch or they will charge a $7.50/month fee."

You manipulate banking procedures to rob hardworking individuals of their money through unjustified fees.  Your poor employees are taught to regurgitate the same scripted responses and you make it impossible to get in touch with anyone who will actually take the time to look at your complaint and answer why or how you can even justify the things you do.  The moment I get back to my home state I am taking my business elsewhere.  I joined your bank because I became friends with one of your branch managers.  You can be certain I am going to tell her first-hand what terrible crooks she is working for and I will tell the networking group we were both members of the same.  You disgust me.  You are truly a disappointment.  I hope your wealthy upper management enjoy their cushy salaries and sleep well at night knowing how they are stealing from their customers.

"1646","Hello BB&T.  Please help!  You have an elderly lady customer of yours here in Greenville, SC, who had her bank account wiped out over 6 months ago via a caregiver theft, where caregiver stole this elderly lady's BB&T ATM card and got her pin somehow and withdrew about $1,300 or so in cash from the BB&T ATM in December, over 6 months ago.  This elderly lady is so distraught as she has tried working with BB&T and the Greenville, SC, police.  She had just suffered a debilitating stroke in December when this caregiver stole her BB&T ATM card and withdrew the $1,300+ cash from your ATM.  This poor elderly lady can hardly communicate due to the stroke but has tried with the help of her adult son (who was also robbed by this same caregiver) to work with BB&T over the last 6 months and the Greenville, SC police, to get this money restored to her.  Can BB&T help her somehow to get this money back?  I think the thief is in jail, but just wondered if BB&T has a policy that helps restore stolen money back to elderly theft victims.  If so, does it usually take this long for an elderly theft victim to get the stolen money back?  This poor lady is considering committing suicide, she is so upset over the loss of this money.  I truly hope she does not take such drastic measures as to take her life.  But she is elderly and had no money to even buy groceries back in December when this theft occurred.  And she had the stroke back in December.  She is understandably distraught as she believes BB&T and the Greenville, SC police do not wish to help her.  Please reach out to her and help if you can.  Respond to me quickly if you can so I can pass along some message of hope to this poor elderly lady before she tries to hurt or kill herself.  I hope it does not come down to that.  I believe BB&T wants to help her, but I am wondering why it's taking so long.  Thank you!"

I understand the administrative fees involved but with today's technology, it is mostly done by computers and it really doesn't cost the bank that much. I get a fee but $36? REALLY? There is also no reason that when you make a deposit it sometimes takes days to credit your account. Again, technology should allow instant credit to your account, just like it does a withdrawal transaction, but NO. Unfortunately, all banks do this. Why can't so type of regulations be put on the banking industry to stop the ripping off of their customers?"
"1658","BB&T I personally dont think anyone should have to wait 2 business days to get 500$ cash back after your atm messed up.

There are banks that don't charge this. If it was the banks money, I can understand. But BB&T is taking advantage of my ADD. What's worse, the reason I overdraw is because the bank takes out my bill payments early, charges the fees, and takes THAT out!  What the heck is scheduled bill payments about, if you have to watch every slimy move?  If I wanted to babysit my bank account, I'd keep my money under my mattress with a rifle in my hand.

I think it’s important that when a problem exists or happens from a bank that we seek and find someone that’s willing to help and solve the problem.

She gave me her card and money and after entering her code and the machine opening the deposit tray I handed the money to the deposit tray and it closed its door and said “your money has been optioned, atm out of order”. No deposit slip and after no help from inside my daughter is out of her money. TALK ABOUT NOT TRUSTING THE BANKS, THIS TAKES THE CAKE. Radio and TV gotta hear this one. Unbelievable how do you people sleep at night? Taking people’s money like that and turning away! To be cont’d"

"1707","BB&T is the worst bank EVER. They have placed a hold on my account for a check that I deposited yesterday. That is all fine and well. Then they placed a second hold on my account making my account -$36981.28. They refuse to remove the second hold on my account. I am told I will have to wait until July 23rd for this to be corrected. Screw you BB&T, I will be taking my business elsewhere immediately!!!"

BB&T - let’s get some consistency. Your employees and back office IRA department should have the same information. I’ve been meaning to switch banks and messing with my retirement may be my final straw."

"1716","This is probably by far the worst bank ever!!!!!!!! The app is never accurate... I can clearly see the money comes out of my account on a transaction but when it posts days later I’m hit with overdraft charges!! Once I clear my charges I will find somewhere else to go"
"1717","Worst bank ever. Especially their legal department.  Be ware of any loans from this institution."
"1718","BB&T I personally dont think anyone should have to wait 2 business days to get 500$ cash back after your atm messed up. And by messed up, I mean it shut off during the transaction in which I deposited it. That 500$ was from hard earned money and being  deposited into your bank to pay my car payment. 2 business days for that kind of money on your banks error is unacceptable. Its Saturday and I wont know anything until Tuesday."
"1719","Bbt your hours of operation say 9 to 5 I've been calling since 5 after 9 and no one answers and your voicemail says you are currently closed. It's 9:20 and you still don't answer."
"1720","The bank's customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. I've spent the last hour trying to actually speak with a human to let them know that a fraudulent charge has been made to my checking account. I have called the following numbers, 800-226-5228, 800-BANK-BBT, 800-476-4228. Every single number has a recording asking to put in my SS number. When I do, it tells me that the number is not valid and to speak with a BB&T representative and then it hangs up. I can't get through to anyone. I called a branch a couple of hours ago and I got an answering machine and no call back. I finally called the complaint department and spoke with an actual human. She said that there is no way for her to get in touch with customer service and that she can only transfer me to the same number with the same recording asking for a SS number. She is not able to connect directly with Customer Service herself. I asked how I am supposed to get in touch with the bank after hours... she answered I would have to wait and go into a branch or call a branch during business hours. So if my credit card gets stolen after or before business hours, I still need to call a branch. If I am overseas, I would still have to call a branch. Unacceptable and stupid coming from a national bank. Don't use this back for anything. They have the worst customer service. They make cable companies look good. I will be moving my money."
"1721","I have had enough of this bank and with trying to learn what my balance is online. I can't reqad your security questions and I'm always getting them. I've had enough and as soon as all my bills clear, I'm going to find a bank that I don't have to jump through hoops to get a  balance."
"1722","Worst bank Ever!!!"
"1723","I am very disappointed in the ability of customer service to help a banker. My checking account is supposed to be linked to my savings account. I have lost over $100 in 48 hours because the accounts were not linked properly during set up. Instead of customer service being able to help by reversing the charges, they said I had to go back to the branch that set up the accounts for them to fix it... not just any branch, but the one way far away from where I live and work. Why can't they just fix it over the phone?! And now I am out $100+ until I can find time to get off work and go to the bank. Never had these issues with Wells Fargo. My fiancé never has these issues with Bank of America. I'm very upset."

"1727","I thought I’d leave a comment about my first and most recent visit to a BB&T bank in Highland Village Texas. I was taking my daughter to deposit “CASH” into her account.  Whenever she has cash she has to deposit it as fast as possible and has told me of issues with this bank in the past but I never really gave it long thought until this recent trip. I pull up to the atm/automatic deposit screen (note there are no windows for drivers to see or talk to while banking in your car, which I thought was completely against customized customer care, and she gives me her card and number. I selected the appropriate options for “cash deposit” and while I have the cash in hand I make a note that each bill ($34 in total) is crisp and note crumpled. The small door opens up to insert your cash so I do so. I insert the cash until the machine makes notice of it and it clamps down and a screen shot comes up and says “YOUR MONEY HAS BEEN RETAINED”. And it does not give me and option or ability to press for any option to try and make contact with the bank. So I began to become worried (as I normally would with anyone or anybody taking my money forcefully without any regards to why or what for) and I turned to my daughter and explained what just happened. We pull on through the “drive thru” atm and park in front. My daughter enters the bank and makes contact with a employee. I wait a mere 5 minutes and go into the bank which is close to becoming closed for the day (approx 4:45pm). They have no record of the deposit and she pleads her case that she was with her father and just seconds earlier made the deposit. So we had to leave with no money and to come back tomorrow. The employees states that my daughter will have to file some sort of “deposit claim” and that this can take up to 3-4 weeks. So I ask you this, in today’s fast pace environment of making fast secure purchases on the go do you really think a bank that can’t fix a “small deposit of cash” problem deserves your trust in your life’s checking and savings and your mortgage? I was disturbed to say the least and very worried. To be cont’d and updated later.............."
